## 1. BUILD ARGS
# These allow changing the produced image by passing different build args to adjust
# the source from which your image is built.
# Build args can be provided on the commandline when building locally with:
#   podman build -f Containerfile --build-arg FEDORA_VERSION=40 -t local-image

# SOURCE_IMAGE arg can be anything from ublue upstream which matches your desired version:
# See list here: https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/packages?repo_name=main
# - "silverblue"
# - "kinoite"
# - "sericea"
# - "onyx"
# - "lazurite"
# - "vauxite"
# - "base"
#
#  "aurora", "bazzite", "bluefin" or "ucore" may also be used but have different suffixes.
ARG IMAGE_NAME="${IMAGE_NAME:-silverblue}"
ARG SOURCE_IMAGE="${SOURCE_IMAGE:-silverblue}"
ARG SOURCE_ORG="${SOURCE_ORG:-fedora-ostree-desktops}"
ARG BASE_IMAGE="quay.io/${SOURCE_ORG}/${SOURCE_IMAGE}"
ARG FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION="${FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION:-rawhide}"

## SOURCE_SUFFIX arg should include a hyphen and the appropriate suffix name
# These examples all work for silverblue/kinoite/sericea/onyx/lazurite/vauxite/base
# - "-main"
# - "-nvidia"
# - "-asus"
# - "-asus-nvidia"
# - "-surface"
# - "-surface-nvidia"
#
# aurora, bazzite and bluefin each have unique suffixes. Please check the specific image.
# ucore has the following possible suffixes
# - stable
# - stable-nvidia
# - stable-zfs
# - stable-nvidia-zfs
# - (and the above with testing rather than stable)
ARG SOURCE_SUFFIX="-main"

## SOURCE_TAG arg must be a version built for the specific image: eg, 39, 40, gts, latest
ARG SOURCE_TAG="rawhide"


### 2. SOURCE IMAGE
## this is a standard Containerfile FROM using the build ARGs above to select the right upstream image
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}:${FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION}

ARG IMAGE_NAME="${IMAGE_NAME:-silverblue}"
ARG FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION="${FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION:-rawhide}"

COPY akmods-addons.spec /tmp/akmods-addons.spec

ADD https://negativo17.org/repos/fedora-multimedia.repo \
    /tmp/rpmbuild/SOURCES/negativo17-fedora-multimedia.repo


### 3. MODIFICATIONS
## make modifications desired in your image and install packages by modifying the build.sh script
## the following RUN directive does all the things required to run "build.sh" as recommended.

COPY build.sh /tmp/build.sh
# COPY github-release-install.sh /tmp/github-release-install.sh
COPY build-kmod-evdi.sh /tmp/build-kmod-evdi.sh
# COPY build-displaylink-rpm.sh /tmp/build-displaylink-rpm.sh

RUN mkdir -p /var/lib/alternatives && \
    /tmp/build.sh && \
    /tmp/build-kmod-evdi.sh && \
    ostree container commit

## NOTES:
# - /var/lib/alternatives is required to prevent failure with some RPM installs
# - All RUN commands must end with ostree container commit
#   see: https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/container/#using-ostree-container-commit
